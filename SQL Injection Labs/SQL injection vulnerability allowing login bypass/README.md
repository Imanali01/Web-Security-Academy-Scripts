## SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass
### Lab Scenario
  This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the login function. To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the `administrator` user.

### Instructions
To solve this lab using the script:
1. Access the lab here: `https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/lab-login-bypass`
2. Run `python3 script.py <your lab URL>`.
   The script will log in as the administrator user and provide you with the cookie for that session.
3. Open your browser's developer tools, go to the Cookies section under the Application tab, replace the session cookie with the one provided by the script, and refresh the page.
