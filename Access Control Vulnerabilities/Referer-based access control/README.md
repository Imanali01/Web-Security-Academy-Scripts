## Referer-based access control
### Lab Scenario
This lab controls access to certain admin functionality based on the Referer header. You can familiarize yourself with the admin panel by logging in using the credentials `administrator:admin`.
To solve the lab, log in using the credentials `wiener:peter` and exploit the flawed access controls to promote yourself to become an administrator.
