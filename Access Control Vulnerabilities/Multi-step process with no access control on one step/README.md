## Multi-step process with no access control on one step
### Lab Scenario
This lab has an admin panel with a flawed multi-step process for changing a user's role. You can familiarize yourself with the admin panel by logging in using the credentials `administrator:admin`.
To solve the lab, log in using the credentials `wiener:peter` and exploit the flawed access controls to promote yourself to become an administrator.
