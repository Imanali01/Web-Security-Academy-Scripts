## Method-based access control can be circumvented
### Lab Scenario
This lab implements access controls based partly on the HTTP method of requests. You can familiarize yourself with the admin panel by logging in using the credentials `administrator:admin`.
To solve the lab, log in using the credentials `wiener:peter` and exploit the flawed access controls to promote yourself to become an administrator.
