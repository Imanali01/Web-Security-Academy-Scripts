## Exploiting XInclude to retrieve files
### Lab Scenario
This lab has a "Check stock" feature that embeds the user input inside a server-side XML document that is subsequently parsed.
Because you don't control the entire XML document you can't define a DTD to launch a classic XXE attack.
To solve the lab, inject an `XInclude` statement to retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

### Instructions
To solve this lab using the script:
1. Access the lab here: `https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe/lab-xinclude-attack`.
2. Run `python3 script.py <your lab URL>`. The script will solve the lab and display the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.
