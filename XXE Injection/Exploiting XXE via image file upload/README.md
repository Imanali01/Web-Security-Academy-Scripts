## Exploiting XXE via image file upload
### Lab Scenario
This lab lets users attach avatars to comments and uses the Apache Batik library to process avatar image files.
To solve the lab, upload an image that displays the contents of the `/etc/hostname` file after processing. Then use the "Submit solution" button to submit the value of the server hostname.

### Instructions
To solve this lab using the script:
1. Access lab here: `https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe/lab-xxe-via-file-upload`
2. Run `python3 script.py <your lab URL>`. The script will upload an image file and provide a link to the page where the uploaded image can be viewed.
3. Follow the link provided by the script and scroll to the comments section. Look for a comment by the user `hacker`.
4. Right-click on the avatar image associated with the comment and open it in a new tab. The image will contain the contents of the `/etc/hostname` file.
